Ke eping the Secret of Gene tic Test Test ing
What is genetic risk ?
Gene tic risk refers to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People get certain disease because of genetic changes .
How much genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes a ssociated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you define ly will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes a ssociated with an increased risk of a heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease .
However , for some rare disease s , people who have certain gene changes are guarantee to develop the disease .
When we are di ago , no sed out with certain disease , are we supper ose to disc los ease this result to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On the one hand , we do not want this potential danger , causing  First ten ghning affects our families ' later lives .
When people around us know that we have got certain diseases , their orchestras will easily be changed , whether the caring using too much or keeping rather away from us .
And both are not what we want , since most of us just want to live as normal people .
Sur rounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are dis tracted wo n't ry or ry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we will never know when the ' pot ' will explode .
On the other hand , if there can help us to control or cur disease , we can go through ses process from the whole family .
For example , if it er cising , it is helpful for family potential diseases , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
And we keep track on all family members .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members of this disease .
Here I want to share the forest 's view on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a excellent genes for Hunt s ' disease has an ethicatory al obligation to disc los that , e fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , he to communicate e his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethicy all duious bious .
"
No cycling is absolute right or wrong .
If a certain disease , genetic test is very accurate and it is unvoided , able to get treatment and known by others , it is OF to disc los ease .
A bove all , life is more important than secrets .
Gene tic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken light ly within family circle .
After all , what affects one family may or may not affect another , although families has a common genetic make up , shared by either of the parents .
In cases , where an individual has gotten to know of genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the div ivial moral system .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly de bat , although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entire , because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either , his parents ' and patern alterns , a unts or cousins .
This also means that as soon , a person is made a ware of his or her genetic profile , he or she 's curently has a knowledge about others .
This knowledge may be lavt an lavt them , and vice s .
An example that may serve as an example is breast cancer .
It is her ed it ary .
Do one who suffered from this disease keeps it a secret about in drast of their relatives ?
In addition , it is also one specting duty to ensure that he or she had cheic health checks in their own .
Sometimes , some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
De pen ding on whom the genetic risk was discovered from : the son or daughter , for example , the parents who know s about this decide who gets told and whom whom they takes the further nce in being ' al ' alarmed ' to tell .
For example , within a family , regard less who had first received genetic information , parents have seen as primary responsibility to pass on information to any offs practise , either adults at risk .
In addition , a woman regulation , positive for B R CA 1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disc los , such information to a niece or nephew rather than doing it , although this may be further complicated by an individual response to information as they want to know .
Hence , there were also tension s if participants felt that they could n't either pass on information to relatives who need ed to know ( such as nieces and nephew s ) or  persuade those e authorities ( the parents ) to do so .
The not ion of authorities also ' extended ' vertically ' .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an a unt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the unt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective , these finding s are important because if lay s of the family and kind are a social constructed they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which about blood ( or non - blood ) s should be informed by and this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural context and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assisting those at risk to make ed decisions about disc los ure .
Who se duty it is to inform at relative s or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how ' direct ive the risk is to them .
People with close blood relationships generally carry some similar genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his / her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk , so that his / her a fmiling members are able to perform some daily es to prevent the disease or they may go to hospital and check the hospital on s in the pgs .
In my opinion , although the ou ouance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self - privcy , it is necessary for the beginning to be obliged to tell the issue to tell his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
Focus on the negative side of an n't ouance of genetic risk .
Large numbers of patients with genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
In special specially for the young people without marrigs , if he / he is known to have some genetic risk , it may have a certain chance that his child would carry the same disease , but not in certain diseases .
The refore , to keep the information as secret to his / her future , spou would help the relationship .
Secondly , an n't ance the potential risk would cause family members to be scared of this certain issue . Although the factor will not be serious , people will still fear that they will have some potential diseases in the future , thus go hospital to hospital and take additional medicine in order to prevent the disease , and creating this s s ces of the family .
Furthermore , the ouance of genetic risks will affect the relationship with the relatives as sometimes others may not think to stay too close to the death , so that they have less chance to get the potential disease .
On the other hand , if genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit to a certain extent and help to keep the privcy , but it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives .
First , for the case of marrig e e , people should be honest and tell his / her spou ce . They may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their off s ring s .
It is better to let the other party know that the fact than after the baby is born and certain type of genetic disease is found .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habit s .
For example , if a might be told that he / s he has the risk to have a dib et ses .
In this case , the only can eat less can eat  dies and chocolate s to prevent them to take much sugar - s , and at the same time , if the beginning tell this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have a dibes in the future be use of genes and they can do the same exercise in the same disease .
Other wise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up with have dia be in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk of the government s relatives over weight s the costs .
The refore , it would be better for the privilege of being obliged to tell information to relatives . In order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercise s .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large number of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
Gene tic disorders or may not be hired at aged her ed it a disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases .
It is a long time discussion that whether a universally of genetic risk should be obliged to tell his or her relatives that his disease was that his disease was caused by genes .
From legal aspect , the answer is no but from ethic al aspect , the answer should be y es .
We ca n't ' t make a law to push arise of the known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem .
It is im mor al and impract ical .
Firstly , someone has done what kinds of diseases are going to his or her privcy .
Privices protection belongs to one 's human rights .
If a law requires someone to tell others ' or her privcy , especially when one is not wo n't go to do so .
It is again for her or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirits .
The law 's spirits also include the fair ness .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorder and other disorder s .
It is unser air into release a law only point to genetic disorder .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
A good law should be clear and easy to do ease .
However , there are many problems again , rather asking angry to tell his or her a stive of his or her diseases .
Firstly , what is the range of relatives ?
For example , they only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister ' s sister ' s son 's daughter s ' s nephew ?
If you only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of law .
Other relatives may have the same possibility to have such kinds of disease .
How can a law made by government exemptsing such a group of people preparing to face their pot et ial disease ?
However , from the ethic al point of view .
To sum up of herself , he should have a feeling of ressitate I want to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder .
By doing this , the y may be able to save some lives in their relatives .
It is because it is a four with bad genes may not have those genetic disease . If they can have core sponsying healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene s ' s function has become stronger .
A typical example is genetic caused by ed - ten sion .
Hy per ten sion can be caused by genetic problems which make arise hard digest to the digest fat and salt in blood which can cause ten - sion .
People usually get this kind of self - sion after they become adult .
However , if they have already know they have a gene that may make them have higher poss s I bilities to get - tention .
They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and thus fat and thus to avoid - tension .
In a nutell , our society ca n't push genetic problem , tells his or her disease to his or her relatives , but he or she should be wo n't tell his or tell her relatives about his or about her problem .
By doing so , less from his or her loving one s will suffer from genetic problem .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breaks with oughs are made possible .
Gene tic testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo .
It is able to detect the illness es or disease s and even a child 's parent .
However , it will become a controversial issue , as it becomes a dilem mad for arise of genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
If knowledge of genetic risks was shared in the family or relatives , there might have a chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary pres caution ution to prevent s .
But , if it is a terminal disease , most of the relatives will be dishd upon having knowledge of it .
Therefore , some national s will have the opinion of keeping as a secret .
This essay will discuss whether a bright of genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
Some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confid ential .
Most patients will be de pressed after the real person and her conditions .
If one has genetic disease , after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives , as he might ended up dishes ease his ten extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pess simm into their family .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some seen it as being considered in keeping the genetic risk of getting disease in confid ential .
On the other hand , others may think that it will be considered at telling the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency to get the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cur eence or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , given in the context of current technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is really beed in the early stage .
Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risks , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check - up , which might save them in really is rathering it at a earlier stage .
In conclusion , it will be considered at inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to relatives .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way of seeking medical attention , such as financial issue , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family 's s in her ented medical medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignored about it and it will continue to lead a happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of the disease , it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
All in - in all , it depends on individual and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obliged to inform the relatives if there are s if there are poss s and I sbilities in curing or preventing it .
Genething is a personal decision ; with the kowing owledge that there is a posss I bly it . That is a personal decision or not .
Those e who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even though if there is no risk at all .
The most pre - am in ation is healthy as it will cast away unwans wants and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
For a genetic risk , there should be choice given with regards to informing his / her relatives .
There should not be forced or obliged , I ed to do so , as it may negatively and drastically sically the emotions of genetic risk .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules for regulat and personal freedom of making decisions .
If genetic risk is a minor or a minor child , then most likely the decision of informing relatives should be made with the consideration of parents or legal guardian .
Such patients are still emotional ly volile at ile or they may be un ware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients could harm the psychological state of the family .
Thus , a lot of thoughts to put on the immediately the family , as it could caused a stirt of unwanted events from the patient or the family members itself .
Some family may feel hurt , with regardings to their family , pripri or reputation , on having a knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevent sion towards genetic disorder .
Also , this known information will help their relatives to make decisions and to simil a smirly undergo genetic testing to find out about outcome .
Thus , having knowledge that such genetic disorder is n't be igned , ficial towards their emotss in al thought s .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared , emotional ly and psychologically , of the future outcomes and aid them in making up the coming decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk Honger would be show er ed with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been made known to them .
Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure genetic risk , he / s , he is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide moral e boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with s towards the future of genetic disorder , which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorders will be dependent on the situation and back ung of the affected family , with the lias given choice of given to them on making a decision of  informing others .
A person with the disorder , regarders of mental or physical disorder , it is always easy to be a wared by his or her families .
When things come to genetic issues , it is not that simple any more .
Gene tic disorders is inheritance of generations , but not all of the off s practised s show the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes , a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies , as none of their members reflect any able to disorder s .
As a result , in the case , when one of the members happening uns or not able to nor mal , he should a ware whether the disorder in his body or her body is a risk or not .
After ward , the fact will face - face a serious ethic , which is to reveal the problem with his or her relatives or not .
If the disorders reflect on a kid , the parent will be informed by the med sic s for sure , then the whole family will stay a lert to their bodies ' condition .
In contrast , if there is an adult , adult who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , which will be more complex .
One may think that if the fact is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
That is true and of course , it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Thk in the other way . If a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk , and the risk might be well as inherited to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilen .
And , of course , he or she would think of not have any child after getting married , and the same thought s to the cousins as well .
As a result , the family generation stops by the moment , adult  announces his issue .
In China , the older generation with traditional culture , the background will always think of having more children as well as grandves , to make the family live n't up and stronger .
The reason behind is that , after Whe II , the population of China decreased dramatic all the government and so , the government encourages people to give more birth .
During that period , if one of the family members reflect s genetic disorders , he will fell in an ethic allen dilen math for sure .
The medical treatment during that time is not advanced enough to completely cur him .
He had to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more pros per sy with a potential gene risk .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo gene ric disorder , and let the truth be mined for ever .
This kind of ethic al issue can not be judgeed by others because they will not understand the position and duty in the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully about what the consequences are s of telling the relatives or her genes .
It is an obligation for a specific to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family members to live n't up the family .
Regard less ly , if the disorder is rarely be fatal , or it does not caused any in convenient ence to the face , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the egg should tell his or her relative s about it .
One of the reasons why it is because she needs or a mental support to go through this situation .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with their own issue .
By telling his or her family or her family than being a support . They could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
Other than that , I believe that the st ong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the national .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it will be better for the local to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing .
By making sure that they are a ware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check - up and it will be better if they could even prevent them to happen .
I find that it is important to inform you , especially if it is a tagious , the government could prevent disease from spreading to society .
For every action , there is always pros and cons .
I believe that some of the four s will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members or wry and feel un comfortt able to or even feel ostentized by them .
Furthermore , as it could spend a lot of money on treatment , the answer might not want to be the burden in her family .
I could understand the feeling of the me .
She or he does not want to be the source of un happ inss in the fa mily .
However , we will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the police decide to tell his or her family of the or her condition .
In conclusion , personally , I feel that it is better for the nerves to inform her family members about the issue .
The police should be honest with his or her feelings and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his or her life .
If anything wrong happened to the answer 's lives , without informing the family members , it could make a huge regret them greed in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions to her problem with the family members as there are more head s to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
In the end , I believe that the supports in terms of mental or even mo nets from your family could help the two to fight against genetic disease .
Truy , there are lots of cancer s ' patient who are given second choices to live as a normal person as they have a strong mental support from their love d one .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind health y and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
As the tech on ology has been advancing advancing , it has reached a stage where the advancements some ethic allem dilem s in relation to the a cutual use of techual use on techology .
Gene tic testing has been made possible - it has become easy to tell if one is a summit of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent un necess a ry unpping ins . However , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the former is , in the family .
The question given is whether a universal of a known genetic risk should be obliged to tell his or her relatives and I think that the last should not be obliged to do so , because I be l  live that he or she has right not to know .
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compuls puls or .
Of course , some people may do it to make their future s slightly happier . However , the younger , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknown s and accept the fact s .
If he chooses to live in the uncertain ty that the gene holds and willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that is nor mal 's to everyone in the past gentic and will not be possible .
It could be better for him or her this way .
Some people might say that it is a form of preventing giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real - life .
I personally think this is tidy , he right purpose of going through genetic testing , so that family who can not have a fed to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
However , I be l estive that the portion has right not to oblige at to tell anyone , but it has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethic allem dilem .
If the result turned out , something that the universal can not accept , then it would have been better , not knowing the truth .
I be l ive that even the local has the right not to know the true fact .
After realizing the he or she was sab , the emotional damage , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family due to the fact and creates more unppy on TV .
Over all , I be l ive and that it entirely depends on the fact to share the hard facts and face it with relatives , but he has no obligation to tell still .
In fact , I strongly think that the local people should both a positive and a negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and tas of an appropriate action to the results .
The emotional depression that the police might get and the sense of guilty can be more than expected and could be a burden in the rest of life .
On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will be positive and work together to overcome the ability to overcome the ability .
I think the family will stay ly he al ty as it is , without having emtion altion .
Despite  bates have been around for years , that should be arise for a known genetic risk of being obliged to inform his or her relatives .
Any individual at risk of a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is the pic that discussing it is worth discussing .
This is an issue need to be addressed as family - related to ethic allem lem mad is involved .
In this essay , few arguments will be ed out in the support of view , for any Milan of that known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them wel coming to this new world .
We were crying hard , but we are not alone . It 's our family and relatives that grow up .
Hence , they should be grateful for people and people we would like to share the joy together .
However , in the case , per taining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder , it may seem s no point of sharing , but this involves more than just sharing of bad news .
One defines ly has the right to disc los , or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one s responsibility to inform family and close relatives .
As the case of health issue is related to genetic risk , with key word on " genetic " which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation .
Therefore , I would agree to that it 's s obliged to a lack of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family - related to ethic a malem malem that could be raise up in the future .
Despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disc los , such a health issue or to bear it / her selves , it 's certainly s certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper solution to s .
By doing so , one will feel less stressful in facing such a risk .
Re l a stive s will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards the younger of a known genetic risk .
By informing them , the beginning it is never alone in the fighting of the battle , such a risk disorder .
On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
It is therefore , I would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth .
This would avoid the rise of more family - related to ethic allem ma .
There are more in tangible advantages that could support the stand of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test conducted .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family - related ethic allem ma , it is best for any summit of genetic risk to inform his / her relatives .
The benefits of doing so we igh its disdtages .
More support s must be provided by different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junctions / her to inform relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
This is the common law in society .
However , it leads to a new problem that " should be arise of a known risk of genetic risk be obliged to tell her or her relatives ?
" This issue has been discussed for a long time .
However , there is still a diversity of point of views among people .
Thus , we go to identify the advantages and disdtages of the issue which is " or should not " .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be an xious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a lack of a risk of a genetic risk " .
Fre quently , the intention of the national s does not want to tell their own families to continue their own life without an xious of families .
It is obvious that there will be better for one person to be or ried than many .
However , many of the fact s are not strong enough to overcome the challenges one selves .
With families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against the demon .
Demons is not easily to be defeated and it is required in energy and psychological support .
Facle lie s give you the cour age and support which you can not be lie by yourself .
That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenge s .
Besides that , the risk of the known genetic is very serious that it can not be described .
The serious ness can be larger than our imagination .
Lything on the bed for the remaining life , and even die immediately . These are the consequences which we can not imagine it .
Factory lies are our derest into our lives .
Without their concern and supports , we are hard to stay until this time .
They play the important role in our lives which can not be substitute .
A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically .
The refore , it is our responsibility to tell the relatives to prevent the occur ence of unsir ed consequences .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the 15 's families without the agreement of the agreement .
It is the ethic from staff in a hospital to keep the secret patients .
We can not blam them so that they are li the unsirts ed consequences .
However , the hospital can provide a council or the advice to advice about the action action can be taken .
Therefore , this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again .
It is a method that benefit that benefits two parties which is a win - win situation .
In conclusion , a death of a known genetic risk is encourage d to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
However , there may be some special case that is hard to be defined .
Thus , advice from hospital plays the important role in this .
Like example , it is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of family and even society .
It is a hard decision to make , but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for family and families in the future .
With the risk of being genetic ally disorder , many individuals have done the decision to undergo genetic testing .
With the nature that the results will be known , once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk face - old faces : they should war their relatives about the risk of s and being the same risk of being the same risk - geneticth .
Or they can choose to keep the silent until the next stage is diagnosed .
In my view of my point , a high - known genetic risk should not be obliged to tell his or her relatives , with the following reasons .
First of all , from the angle of human right , a genetic risk , which should not be obliged to tell the truth to others .
This diagnos is able to be regarded as a kind of prive to answer s .
They may not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do not know about it .
This is an reason since the exposure of the truth , the fact that may be able to make them be discried at or sy mpucized by others , which is not positive factors brought to their life .
Sether ly , the relative s of the national can also choose to do genetic testing regard less of the dign ign ignible of the USSR .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it .
If they do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
However , if a digno sgno sed Pass is obliged to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk s .
This obeys their own rather , as they have to accept the truth , which may make their following life able .
Many people argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are relatives of the last s , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnos is .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors , including psychological influence , social influence , are taken into consideration .
If one relative is told that he or she may have a higher risk of getting sick , he or she may be scared about the unknown life , partners , spous sous e leagues and col leagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen which ' relatives may be ruined .
On the other side , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing ly .
In a nut shell , arise of genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
This should be accepted from the point of human right , freedom of accept stance of relatives as well as many other social reasons .
Other wise , making it an obligation ation will rest the choice of retail s and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
Because of genetic disorder to know the fact that he or she is a local , it causes more dilem ma rather than getting the disorder .
I agree that a retired of a known genetic risk is obliged to tell his or her relative s .
There are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorders .
Firstly , the younger and his or her family can take pres caution s , physically by actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited to off s ring and mental up , s ring and mentally , if the action fails to prevent it being inherited .
Manyger s , such as Down Synago , and Taylor , children can be prevented to happen if the mother undergos properly and do n't consume harmful ful good s during the pregnancy period .
This information may not be known by mother if she does n't tell her relatives regarding her condition .
More people ( relatives ) know her problem , more information channels are provided .
If all efforts have been made , but the children still suffer from theger , then the family have to accept this fact and do what ever they can to bring a good environment for their children 's growth .
This is not the parent 's fault because there are still chances in the genes of being inherited .
So , they have to also prepare mentally .
Secondly , genetic diseases have highly costs for treatment and medication .
Al bins are one of the examples .
People with al bins are sens it sensive skin and it needs regular treatment .
Unlike people with high proportion of skin pig igment , people with al bin is prom and other skin diseases .
If they do n't treat their body well , such as by using sung l as s or wearing sun screen in the outdoors , the chance of s are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer .
Once you suffer from cancer , the medication is very expensive .
To prevent the bigger problem , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
If the stage does n ' t tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Thirdly , some diseases are not notice able to and may lead to serious health problems .
One of the diseases is sick le traits .
Usually people are not a ware if they carry the sick le gene gene and this may lead to circulaty or problem , such as blood blocking .
If parents know that one of them is arise and disc los ease the information for their relatives , then they can bring their children to undergoing and do n't need to be shy of it , because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Four ly , it is important for the parents to give mental boost with their children with genetic disorders .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may a rise e .
People and friends often mock from your conditions .
A strong mental condition and Car must be build from within and from the close st one s .
If not their family , then who else is wo n't do that ?
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first by disclosing the information that their children may suffer from genetic disorder .
In this modern world , technologies have improved a lot compared with the last century .
Partic ularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatments for many people in cur diseases in s , and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnos an individual risk of genetic disorder at an individual disorder .
The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family - related ethic dilem ma is born .
The question is whether a retired of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relative s .
In my opinion , the care of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this .
This is because her or relatives have the right to know about this .
As many people realize , genetic disorder can be related to the portion s ' relatives . That is , one of the family members are at risk for a genetic disorder that other family members also have almost equally rather risk of having it , so this problem should be treated by family .
Every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them .
If they do not even know that they are at risk of genetic disorder , how they can this explain their right ?
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder , but he does not tell his sibling , James about this .
Although they tell James about this horrible to some extent , he should be likely to be going on for him .
This might be neficial for his future if he is a ware of the risk of having this disorder .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the similar genetic disorder , prevent giving certain genetic disorders to affect themselves .
Gene tic disorders are in nate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of disorder on themselves .
In addition , doctors usually quote e statement , " Pre vented is better than curation " . This gives us an idea that preventing  disorder to happening more advantages becoming more advantages than curing it .
A warness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the  prevention of a certain disorder possible .
For example , - ten sion is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
People who have a war of having such disorder , can prevent the disorder to be adapting a healthy lifestyle , including having a balance dable diet and at least having exercise for 30 minutes every day .
To sum up , a retired of a known genetic risk should be obliged to tell his or her relatives .
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder to happen .
Together with the advancement of technology over past decades , med ical advancement has increased ponsponentially entially and , further enhancements s are still constantly upgrading . E ming doctor solving with medical knowledge , do n't be able to diagnos and us to help them to prevent s and take necessary to protect their life . However , solving and take their life . However , losing a result , I have a result of losing a losing losing a patient or losing a patient , I have a losing the doctor 'sitation of losing a patient , and I have a losing a sitation of losing a s of losing a patient , and I feeling sitation of s of s , s , losing her opinion , and has a strong knowledge of losing the doctor 'sitation of losing her opinion , and
As it is a genetic risk , the patient next - of - skind might have a high chance of carrying the risk , hence the need to inform their relatives is so important , so that prevent solving sert of your family and I might be taken up in s , or , if you are only the child in a family and for uns , and uns , uns , so that are suffering from a lot of s , so that you do n't be solving the next person , solving the next person and more easily - s , I might be s , so that you do n't be able to do n't have a lot of s , s , but it is s , solving the environment .
However , the er people are still against the decision of revealing private information . A s in the case of Alzing zimer patients , it is still up to the patient 's own choice of s , he still helps information . However , s archers have shown by doctors who have to interpret how , and Alimer patients who will be imer diseases and he will be able to be a negative impacts ( imer members of s ( s ( imer members of imer members ( imer members of s ( imer members of s ( s ( imer members of imer members ( serts , and all the imers are imer members of the s , and all the s , and all the imer members of imment ) and all the imment ) and all the s ,
In conclusion , the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extent should be a doctor opt to reveal to relative s members about the genetic disease and , in which situations , it is open to patient 's decisions . In addition , the state they can also create assistance to be necessary to help them to encourage people to open their benefits and benefits for their own family members of s . Although they can be able to do n't be able to do n't have a long - s .
Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high - velocy it technological advances .
Not long ago , the human 15 project , universally by several large multi multi corporations ( M NCs ) have been started .
In comparison , in the field of genetic testing , which enables people to be a ware of the risk of genetic disorder , as technology has been very mature , even more popular topic rise .
While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo genetic test or not , they have different stands in whether it is the patient 's responsibility s responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives .
In my opinion , patients which are universally s of some known genetic risks are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
A dmit ted ly , it is social obligation to be responsible for other people .
To the whole society , it is a duty .
Take 1 N N. 1 as an example , all the people in Singapore , including students at school , travel ers at the Changers , workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result of the government in charge .
To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their love d one s who they really are and get their love d ones in danger ?
The basis of a family is that everyone trust s and love each other with no doubt s .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunne of strange rs living together .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder , both as social responsibility and a favor to conserv the family e basis .
More over , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and eily est way to get their support .
Without the support of love d one s , patients ' life is no better than death .
Family members , as one close the group of people , from whom they can get comedt , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible trouble s as a result of genetic disorder .
A study of New York University in 2010 shown that patients with family members around generally recovers 2 - 4 days faster than those taken care of by professional nurses .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their surviv al% is 30% longer due to family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth may arise ease some unscess a doubt and panic sic s which will endanger the family harm on y .
While every family need to go through this or that kind of trouble some situations , the more trouble s that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
Hence , for a family in which every member is ly believing in each other and loving each other , all these troubles are just test a ment sment to make them stronger .
It is just as the lyrics of the reception son , which does n't kill you make you stronger .
Being in Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice . I do think that it is the choice of the patient , whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease or her disease .
The cour age to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have result in people to be composed while it is just a risk and not a risk and not a confirmed  case .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's genes that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with .
Nevertheless , while I fell that a universal should not be obliged to tell his or her relative s about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband ) or wife ) , since the 's individual genetic risk may affect their future children .
Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely to judge or at least different I ate those who have genetic diseases , since they feel that the patients are a bmal normal or we ' dir .
This is because many relating to genetic diseases , such as Bub ubble - Because y disease , a utm is or down - sert s , responsibilities .
In those diseases , many who are affected actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic disease s .
While we do know that we should not get discri mins on them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them  realizing it .
In this particular case , we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about having a RIS IS of a particular genetic disease .
It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and , therefore , it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in some case , people judge them or treat them differently . Man people really love to what they want to he want to ar and , therefore , they may ignore the word they can just be rise the world 's and assume the person that has suffer from the person .
To prevent that , from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family , since his family may either be para noid or judge him and act differently ly .
E special ly when it is just a risk , the option is really ly his since he is not an actual sufferer .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk , since some of them may be affected , while I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case .
Maybe we can trust our immediately family members but we can really trust all the other relatives ?
Furthermore , since genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person 's call to tell the relatives about it .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tells the potential risk of his or her future partner since his genetic risk may affect his children later .
This information needs to be at least fixed ed by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
There may be possed s I sbilities when both the husband and wife are younger and , so , they should not have any child , since their child may not be able to survive , even after they are born .
Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , so , although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner .
In conclusion , whether or not the Mexican wants to tell his relative s regarding his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right right of it .
He may have different considerations s other than due to jud ging people or may result in making his family or ry for nothing when thinking about whether he should tell it to his relatives , and no matter what no matter he makes we need to respect and we have no right saying that he must tell his relatives about it .
We all know that life is price less and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
With the improvement of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected .
Gene tic refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
The refore , an entirely new dilem ma is born : should a retail of a known genetic risk be obliged to tell his or her relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why relatives are obliged to be informed that their children have genetic risk .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable of to raise a child with genetic risk .
The child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to build up the family with others and most of the time they do not accept the majority .
They may not be able to enjoy yourself a normal people can enjoy .
This competitive world is crug to those are not able to survive .
Parents and relatives have to work , longer than expected and end lessly , to foster their child , if he / he is not able to foster himself / her self .
The situation may become worst if the child has diseases , like cancer , or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy bag named medication s .
Not only the child but also entirely family will suffer .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain in the entire life .
The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a local risk of genetic risk is for a nation 's good .
There are always newspaper report that a new born baby has been abandoned at hospital after they realized the baby has diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure money .
For the countries like Singapore , they are a short of man power to contribute to the nation .
However , every year , the government has to spend a lot to help the disads such as medical ize s and builds up special schools to educe at them .
Without increasing the number of disadvantages in a nation , the government is able to concentrate ease in other ways , like military and education .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
More over . In the world , we lived today , many mis car ri ages conducted in the hospital every day .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
Therefore , I believe parents have their right to know the health inses of their child .
Many people may support the theory that every people have their right to enjoy the world , especially people with religions .
However , the problem is , will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital every day and with all the need les and end less pain ?
Parents know what the best is for their children . Thus , they will make a right decision after they be informed .
Also , human being should improve the medical field in order to prevent the traged y ys happen .
I think a National of a known genetic risk should not be obliged to tell his or her relatives .
Gene tic testing is a personal choice .
One should have the full control of his / her information and it is his / her right to decide whether or not to disc los eases it to some one else .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple are going to have bbies , they are going to run a few test and see whether their genetic diseases could have some genetic diseases .
The results are disc los ed at the husband s and wife s .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the summit are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Also , telling them the result can let them be largely reduce the cost of multiple testing .
They can also take immediately measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
If person has a disease , C that might be a result of genes A .
He runs a test and knew that he had the gene A A .
This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C . They could save the cost of running s two separate test s to see whether they are under high risk of having a disease . If he runs a test and he has the geneed A .
This means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved .
His relative s can then take measures , if this disease can some how be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives .
However , this can also be achieved from personal choice .
One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
Most people care about their relatives , if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
One might also choose to hinhin or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that come s across when they disc los e their genetic results .
There are possible negative consequences that those might face if they disc los eases ease on their relative .
If a person is obliged to tell his / her relatives , he or she might be discried by those who do not carry this gene .
He or she might even be advice not to get married or have children .
For example , if an unri ri ed person has gene A and a gene is a sufficient for a very riou disease .
After he takes the test and be obliged to tell his relative , everyone knows that he was arise .
So , all the married couples go to run a test and know they are not four s . The y subsious siously see him as different and wrying that he will find a wife who he will find a wife who will carry this genes as well .
Third , it is hard to define relative s .
If a gene runs in the family , one of the family member test positive , which does he need to tell .
If that is a big family , he obliged to tell everyone ?
Sp ous es usually have a very close relationship , if a person tells his family that he has this genes . His uncle know s and tells his wife D D that he needed to run a test because his cousin has ease this disease .
However , wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease .
Then wife D might tell her mother , who like s to go ssip on her way to the theatre .
In less than a week , half of the town knows people A risk ed genes , and his family might be a geneticy all risk ed family .
Then no body wants to marry A , or his relative s .
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his / her information , especially when the party that he is obliged to disc los that his information is a potentially ly large group ( relatives ) .
In conclusion , a retired of a known genetic risk should not be obliged to tell his or her relatives .
Students ier of a known genetic risk should be obliged to tell his or her relative s .
Nowadays , people not only do the comrather for their own life , but also a better development of their following generations .
Since technology of modern society has been so advanced , it becomes possible for people to make decisions to take genetic test , so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation .
The de bat able to question , an ethic al dilem ma , is that people are responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
And there are two basic reasons .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self - well ness and health of your relatives and the second one is being responsible for the next generations .
The awareness of your relatives and families about genetic risk is good for your self - ness and health of your relatives .
Because if you are carrying that genetic risk , then there is a great possibility that your relatives like parents or siblings are carrying the same genetic risk as well .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
If you have n ' t undergo the genetic testing , it 's just odd and ate what will happen to both of you and your relatives .
However , if you have to undergo up and known that , you are arise , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even though you can not eliminat e the risk completely , you can at least try to be a lery to avoid ing getting the disease .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to do the check s regularly .
The refore , telling the family families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to get the disease is your responsibility .
Furthermore , you are also being responsible for your next generation s by telling the truth that you are arise of a genetic risk .
If your wife is not a ware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Being the parent , you are not responsible for you next generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generations and being a ware of it .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a chance about whether to have child or not .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering  geneing is perfect and widely used , then you can then choose to give birth to giving them by giving them a bright future .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing at the first place .
As a conclusion , once you have undergo the genetic testing and being a ware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself f , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth .
To tell or not to tell you .
Con side r a case , we decide to undergo genetic testing and have known a result of it .
We found that we actually are the genetic risk .
Then it becomes trouble to whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well .
There are really ly a lot of things we need to consider .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole life .
As a result , what should we do ?
T ell them or keep this secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health status .
For example , dib et es is a kind of genetic disease .
Once we found , we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
If we tell them , they may start to pay more attention to their daily habits , like eating less sugar contained food and keep ood a good mood .
And it is important for young people .
The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will rise and better for their lives .
What 's more , they may undergo genetic test as well to see whether they are carrying it or not , which is also better for them .
However , some people may argue that why we want to interfere in their lives ?
Sometimes , it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news , especially if they are going to know that they or their free ants may have a severe disease like blood disease , which is untrething at able to be able .
Img ine you are living like a normal person . But suddenly one day your relatives will tell you that actually there are some poss s and I sbilities that you may encounter some disease in the future , which kind of feelings you are going to have ?
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .
We become so an xious that we can not focus on everything .
At the same time , there will also be a chance that the genetic test result is not correct , which means they are actually ting their lives or rying about this thing , so actually we are bringing trouble to them .
Per son , all I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try it in a positive way .
We can not let it go .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make correct choices in the future .
It is only after we tell them they start rather attention to their health .
They will consider whether to give a birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding their baby to carry this risk as well .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
May be after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our love d ones , we need to tell them and help them .
A genetic risk of genetic - should be obliged to tell
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused social controversy .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of priving a cy for the local and should be protected .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a retail of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her current situation .
This essay will illustrate two aspects .
First of all , it can be an a ler about the family members of the patient and let them be a ware of the possible disease that they may also have .
As we all know , genetic risks are likely to pass the genetic s on their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying risk y genetic , other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease .
Some of the disease s may not show symptom until the stage is old enough .
Therefore , telling relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save time for proper treatment .
Sometimes , life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct time ly treatment .
So , for the consideration of other family members , relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can avoid genetic diseases passed to the next generation when they in ten drunk to have a bies .
They should let their spous eous know about his or her situation before marriage .
They need to ask for doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
Some genes will only pass boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
If the police refuses to tell the truth to his or her spous eous e , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
I notice dr a real story in newspaper years ago .
A couple in China has a son of 5 years old .
Their son , unsunate ate ly fell ill and he was diagnosing is a kind of genetic disease which is very serious .
They were told that the wife 's family were carrying the played genetic disorder and can only pass to boys rather than girls .
The refore , their son was inherited by the genetic disease .
However , the wife actually had already known about the played genetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband .
The son was died after one year 's treatment and the couple got divorced later after that .
If the wife had not hide the truth , and asked the truth , for doctor 's advice before they have baby , the traged ragic would not happen .
In a nut shell , arise of genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
On the one hand , it can tell members of the local people 's family that the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if possible .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease next generation if the local generations hide the truth .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do a genetic testing .
We can not deny that genetic testing really help people a lot when they face the problem .
However , I thought that genetic information is one person 's personal information which should be protected by the law .
The refore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obliged to tell her or her family or relatives .
There are three reasons .
Firstly , information concerned about genetic cycling is something personally which is also a privcy , like people 's bank card .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission , even though they are his or her family or relatives .
The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy .
Once people 's s genetic information is told to other people .
They may know the person 's potential disabled or other bad things .
They may set a bi as on this person , even abandoned her or her .
People do not have the ability to choose their genes . They should not be thought badly because of bad genes .
So I think what the ever genetic is or whether the gene match is with their parents . It should not be told to anyone even about her or her family or relatives .
Secondly , the fact of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken relationship between children with the adults .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have a relationship with them .
However , they were happy before , there would be some barriers which will truly destroy the family gradually .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tests ed only in the genetic way . It is something much deeper and tight er .
The parents give knowledge and love to the children , mean while they feel happy with her of the children .
The children rely ly on the parent to live .
When they grow up , they take care of the old parents and than in their dedication .
The relationship between parents and children are something about love and dedication .
Every one does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the police of a known genetic risk .
Therefore , I think genetic risk should not be obliged to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's s permission .
Finally , the technology of testing is not very mature , and is not very mature now .
There also exists some probability of wrong testing .
If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life .
The refore , I think a know about genetic risk should not be obliged to tell his or her family or relatives .
Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing . For peace of the family , I support that genetic risk should not be obliged to tell her or her family or relatives without the person ' s permission .
A year ier of a know n Gene tic Risk Shoul d be Obraged lane to T ell his or Her letive a l stive s
More and more illness are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of medical technology .
People will know about whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have done the genetic test .
If there is no problem , that will be won determine ful .
However , not every body is so luck cky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes .
Therefore , once people find their family members they have carried up genes . They should be responsible for telling their relatives , at least their family members .
It may be a wward ward and emra ss sed for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a loud of a known genetic risk .
But they are all from one family and owning the same for a ef , then of course , they own the same genes in some part .
Therefore , there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
If the person tells their relatives that he or she carries a disease , his or her relatives can go to a hospital to check whether they also get a disease genes .
Then the relatives can prepare themselves with preventing the disease to occur .
Also , they can prevent the disease that they can prevent their diseases .
If the relative s carry that disease genes , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help , they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
If he or her not get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he carries a disease .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctor s .
Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a un he already y baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
There is a story I watched on TV .
A couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time , their parents were an xious about that and asked them to go to the hospital to check what was the problem .
After came back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carries a disease , so that they can not have a baby in their life time .
The woman did not know the test result , but she over the ard talk and decided to divorc with her husband .
After got the divorcing e certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carries d the disease instead of the man .
At that time , the woman known how much her husband loved her , but she was ruined her happily inss .
Te ar s showed nothing .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes , which they can be born with .
However , they can avoid the disease gene s are being in her ed to their children .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease can make their family members 's bonding closely . Also , many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
Genetic testing has become a neficial way to predict and protect each individual at a risk of disorder .
However , there are rise s and a family - related to ethic allem mad , if it is right to tell arise 's family once , the test has been conducted and the results are known .
I am most in clined to believe that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk exist , the consequences will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
Then they are unable to have a suitable e method to protect themselves and emotional preparations .
Ta king Angel in Jo lie , for example , she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast risk .
Everyone is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope .
People may feel a ngry , de pressed , or even guilty about their results .
In some cases , arise can suffer within a family because the result is also related to others ' risk some how .
However , I believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation .
In addition , though it can be possible in some cases , he or the family can undergo specific discrimination and their social life , how people can face more dramatic raged such as sickness or death if they can not overcome this harsh situation .
Life is hard , but people can not blame it to be unser .
It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome a hard time .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse , you should feel guilty and de pressed .
In addition , the truth can not be hidden for ever , but when it is revealed , more shocking and up it will be able to be .
As the result , it is in the interesting s of the local s and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result of your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's s health .
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of society and an xity about the risks .
To put it in the nut shell , I believe that people should have obligation to tell their relatives about geneticever result for the good of their health .
It can be very difficult for them , but necessary for the local s and their family .
In addition , emotional preparation s and the ways you explain your genetic condition is also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and if necessary to guide them if he / hes he wish to conduct a similar bicycle .
The Imp act Of media
Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today .
It is almost impossible ible for us to keep the way from it .
I started in v oving on Facebook one years ago . He just arrived , I just sing ap ore .
And now I got over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself , fnd with ndn s of seed s of every day .
We know each others ' status , change ments and so on the social media .
For example , if we change our contact numbers , we will not send SMS on each of each individual any longer .
Instead , we will post our friends and our friends to inform this kind of changments .
And if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenient .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking through TV since it is free .
We discuss every thing we like and we have more personal space . Our friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
And also , we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their lives better .
In China , a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicat with people , like fire fighters , police stations and so on .
So , the media allows them to explain or to inform people about .
And actually lots of s of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people to get lost and so on .
With more convenient and humans ian communication , the relationship between government and people get largely improved .
What 's more , various cultures can be shown to us through social media s .
We can know more news and culture s through so cia media s .
From this scope , social media has a short distance .
However , we get fewer chances and less importance to talk face since social media is so convenient , advanced and interesting .
And even gather together , more people find themselves have a less topics to talk than before and choose going to digging from their social media again .
When we are far away , social media makes it as we are in front of each other ; sometimes when we are by each other ' side , we are seemed to be further than far away .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationship as not as stable , secure and reliable than before .
Besides , there are more people sh wing their pictures of y yum my food or travelling experience .
To some extent , this makes our life more lu xry and bled under bling .
Because of myself , I am long some places after I saw those in ful pictures taken by my first until n't s .
Sometimes I even can ot sleep well because of citement .
Social media makes our lives dispatched , so fast and left us less time to think about our lives .
Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better .
Inter person al skills , like any other skills requires practice .
Besides that , these skills require s time to develop and adapt ed .
The burge on cycling of social media , it defines ly has its retail ; but amongst all good things , it is better to have them in the mode of modes of ration .
Conven , I ence and efficiency are two very important use of social media .
While million s of users are connecting at any one time , any information can be read , I ly available at their per us al .
This improves the connect ivity between the users .
For example , one is able to send not ification and other information we use them in hard copy , over the web and the process takes second process .
The rece ip ipent , w ill , then receive information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network .
This coven ence I can be per cieved eved as almost in real time .
Next , communication are also greatly improved .
In the past , vast communication are done by one of the such as many television grams , and poor - quality voice .
With the wel coming of the application such as Sky pece and Face time , any individual can off most old encouraging communication methods .
A side from hearing the voice , a web camer a could also be a ffix ixed to emulate a ' al interaction with expressions and ges sture sture sture .
Communication would have taken a different turn without easily social media .
However , it is a good practice not to in tesive ly use social media all the time .
In timate interaction , greatly lack of social media interaction , particularly the touch .
Having to meet and interact for talk s allow s one to be closer to the receient pient .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which ut ses motor , thinking and verbs alg t ex of the mind to coordinat coordinat coordinat .
Unlike the use of social media , most of interaction is done with thinking and tying .
As a result , one does not train the necessary parts of the skills required for a proper person .
It is also entire incorrect to fault 's social media alone for the lack of interm skill .
Government Garner studied ed the effect of multiple intelligence s amongst people and stated that inter intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some has , some do not .
Together ner mentioned that the different intelligences can be chart s chart , in agreement of utilis s , and ranked .
Fund a ment all , those who scored lower ranking for inter ranking skills al skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is need ed .
Though social media need not be necessary to badly , it must be used according to work , family , friends .
The types of use must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussion and others .
The space of separation must also be ed at .
For people who are living very far from one another , the in ten sive use social media is just ified .
For those who lives within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of commun with each other .
And at the same time , improves the interl person al skill , through dynamic practise , it is sitate to be ww individuals and real time presence .
The in clusion of timate presence and relatives could also bring a better rap port between those interacting .
Recently , the rise of social media helped people to have more closer connections with each other . It is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with faces to face meeting s .
In my opinion , social media website s such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to face to contact and thus negatively  affects inter person al skills .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of face contact ung people .
First , social media networks have a lot of user basis . It helps people from different parts of the world .
On the days without the social networks , people may not have the chance to know others from different countries or the ones they never meet before .
Their number of people that they know may only limited people they meet in daily life , like classmates and working partners .
The refore , social network s bring s more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chence at people they never known before , and this helps to develop the interest in interm skills al as well .
Secondly , although social network takes time for people to ch online , but not face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face in daily life .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk .
For example , if social networks do not exist , the business people need to meet each other face to face and it is other time consuming , even sometimes with business that are not so important , it still takes a lot of time on , which is a TV age .
However , social network helps people to meet and ch at much more easier , they can even use video ch at and create a group to ch at multiple parties at the same time .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interview with their applicants , as it saves time and cost .
social network may also creat some negative impact on people .
The largest negative impact is that , due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on the internet every minute .
They take too much time of using online social networks and thus do not have time to have their daily meeting with people in their real life .
It not only affects the inter person al skills but also bad for people 's health if ones spend a lot of time on the social media .
Secondly , social network may leak certainly , personal information s on public , as the cy is not perfect and not safe , people may not protect their privcy , cy online rather effectively and sometimes , some people may use others personal information to ceive .
In conclusion , although the unsf online environment , we spend too much time on the internet , may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
It also helps people to develop their inter person al skills through online ch ating .
In all , there are more benefits than the cost of the costs .
The ol rd - cred is in creding ly becoming flat by all the kinds of social network , such as the face book and TV witter .
We can even know what a friend who leave thousands of miles away eating for lunch though these kinds of social media .
From some points of view , social really has a lot of advantages , by let us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently veniently wo n't .
However , it 's disd van tages can also be in gno red when you co side , r it as a platform to show off and a stage for cy being a crime .
Social networking sites provides us with a lot of convenient network .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through phone , we can know his latest news by scing an web ping age .
It can help us know more about each other .
It can make people become closer as well .
For example , if you find out one of your friend 's favourite singer is Justin Bir be through face book , you can give him or her Justin Bir 's new album or concert ticket as a gift birthday .
It will be really sweet and you will sure l ly become closer .
In addition , social network site can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
I met some can adian friends in Egypt .
Without face book , we may lose contact .
However , thanks to face - book , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing recently as we live close to each other .
The disd van tages of social networks are quite undenly .
A research shows that people will be unscious scious of hide his or her real thought when he or her post or something that will be exposed to public .
It means that one can not know another s real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network .
It will make him or quite up set when they communicate in real life .
In addition , with all those " n " ice guy s around the social network website , one may neglect people or her but just communicate with friends on face book .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other , but just look at their cell phone .
This kind of behaviour is not good for people 's psychological health according to a research .
The cy ber communication is quite different to face communication and people who depend on cy be communication too much will not get used to real life communication .
In addition , cy ber relationship can not always work in real life .
With no close relationship in real life , but only close cy , friends , one is more possibly to feel lonely because the physiological needs of human beings is to feel the bond with others by our five senses .
With the rathering of people to become the best among others , social network now become a place to show off .
Some people will to post their expensive thing or the over sea places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satfaction by doing so .
It is an mental unhaps and it may trigger people , especially teenagers to become material .
The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network , it is covenient for criminal to make of this information to commit a crime .
A bove all , social network site is like two side knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disdtages to tages of it , such as put less personal information on his or her face page .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social network sing .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication to be faster than never before .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within contemporary society ; and people can communicate with each other , online or off line , on these social networking platforms .
They can even make new friends over similar interests in these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interaction s among people , as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to go out and meeting new friends .
This essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media are able to dis separated at information faster than any other media .
There are about 50% of people who have learn about breaking news from social media .
This is due to people spending compare tive more time on social networking than time on reading new pas .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smart phone s are able to get access to social media sites which have made easier for consumers to use .
Hence , social media has benefited ed the mass es by equipping them with a powerful to ol to dismeol ate information almost immediately to the people around them .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news dis separated on are relied able to .
There might be false information or hox es spread es around on social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fire s , shoot out s , and car vans of gun in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This had caused panic among people , who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this result had ed temporarily closed from schools .
The spread rather of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can dis se ate information in a real tive tively fast speed .
Nevertheless , there are cyr police s who ro am around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoxes  spreading around .
But , there will still be unre li sources spread  false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
Social media are able to improve relationships and make new friends , provided that there are mutual trust trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
Many of the teenager s today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regard less of their location .
In the past , people used to writing letters to their friends and it will take a relatively long time to send the letter over .
The refore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up which other convenient ly .
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends who have sim lir s or hobish s .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends , it requires s mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunic communic with each other as they can not sense the to nece of the other party over social media platforms .
This will result in un neces s a conflict sry between two parties over miscommunic communication .
But , if there is trust and mutual understand on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationships and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as , disvert toe information efficiently to the masses .
However , there are risk s of false information and chances of miscommuns communication .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the mass es if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of .
All - in - all , social media is the product of rapid technological advances and there are more to come in the future .
Advt an age s : Social media sites have greatly ease - as long distance communication and interaction due to its accessibility and convenient ence .
With global ised and inter connect ed ed world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream for social interaction .
With just a touch away from any ida / elect ronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much .
Thus , long distance relationships or friendship can be maintain and keep rather in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting sting a status of one 's personal feelings or experience and able to reply to these posts , s allowing human interaction to be engage and expand with ease as ease .
In trovert s or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform .
Thus , social is can occur sea m less ly and effective ly with the utilation is of such social media platforms . M et e - sert and appointment are no longer a barrier to humans and communicate with another human interaction at one s . I 'm ence .
society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction is transformed into cy ber interaction .
With the frequent use and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that sociale is through the cy and relir will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
Disd van tages : One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is ed .
The certain ty of what is being shared or expressed could not be prove n't physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a web ca m to ch at .
We can not be certain for sure of reliing a bilty or truth of some posts or information we received on the In et r net .
We may in actual fact , communicating with a hox , Facebook a ccunt of a cy , which we will be friends , but we assume to be real , but in reality , it is a fake account .
Ph o or to s and information sbred from their profile page may be fabric at to suit certain personal a gen .
Thus , the lack of face - to - face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimuled at the media .
Although em or conses can be used to show certain emotion , this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body language and their facial expression .
The danger of such the media , social is the uncertain ty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human inter - person , al behaviour , since communication is made through social media instead of meet - up s .
This lower s the experience of human ability to interact with one another which can a solving one 's behaviour .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans with not create the confidence and skills need ed for one to interact sea m less and effectively and effectively with others .
The refore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face - to - face human interaction within its people .
Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the artist e or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what is their friends ' recent activity .
Nevertheless , they are still can use the phone to do a normal call and message to contact .
Not only did the phone did the job s for them , but also devices like personal computers , laper tables , and many other devices , which are able to connect on the internet .
It is obvious to see that the internet saves people 's time and also connect people globally .
Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually have some in vit able to be ad van tages to people .
People can only use electronic devices to access the internet .
When ever needed to use social media , they have to use a phone or the internet .
Generally , people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computers and fingers to manipulate .
As a result , they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feelings nearby people , which means they have lost the tools they need for face - to - face contact communicating .
This can be easily seen in restaurant s or ca fe s now a day ss .
A family of four having dinner s in a restaurant without any chting , because their holding and looking at their display with one hand , when the other hand is holding a child for k .
A group of friends having a high tea in a ca fé without chting as well , because they do not know what to talk but the press siting on their display screen .
The children nowadays do not know what neighbourhood games and who are staying on be side , all they know is pressing s iconing on the screen s .
These are some concrete examples of how the so cia media reduce face - to - face human contact .
When people get use of using so cia , the media to contact other people , what will happen , is that their interperson communicating skills will degrading egrading and , eventually , eventually .
Firstly , they have lost the coured age to meet strange rs , not even the couraging age to talk .
Also , they will not have enough experience of communicating ease with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills .
As a result , social media helps them do the job s , but in direct ly affects their inter person al skills .
Social media does have some other advantages s be side their general benefits to human being .
First of all , people save money by using the internet to contact other people and reading the news .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter , who is in other country , via so cia , the media instead of making international call which costs a lot to normal salary family .
He can even talk to her daughter face - to - face using video call via the internet .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and able to update their friends in his recent activity easily .
A guy who is going to travel for a months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity .
When one of his friends who is not a ware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereb out using social media .
These are the advantages that save works most of the time .
In conclusion , so cia , the media benefits people in several ways , but in the same time harms people .
People should avoid the mis use of so cia media and use it in the proper way .
With the aid s of social media , people work s bond , globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives , happily .
All of us are living in technology 's real society .
Have you ever won determine why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?
It started with the invention of technology which has evolved tre men dous ly over the past few decades .
In the past , we travel by ship and now we can use an airplane to do so .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we need to post our letter and now , we can use e - mail which stands for electronic message to send messages to our friends or even use our hand phone to send our messages .
From example , I have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our love drank .
This is because , by the ease of technology , such as airplane , some of our friends might be going to continue their studies or even if you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the medium that we need .
Nevertheless , ever y thing in life has positive and negative effects .
This is applic lic to these social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will be discussing about the advantages and disd van tages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them .
Social media sites such as Facebook has allow us to share our pictures or even ch at online with our parents while we are overseas .
This approach , helps parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities that their children have when they are overseas .
The social media is be neficial as it connects you and your love d one , even though you are separated by the distance .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family , but it could help to reduce the saness of being away from your family .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there is also disd van tages of social media tools .
One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration , especially among the young , sters .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their face book 's page as their friends will post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will b row face book while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not conce trating , when they are supposed to do so .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
This will then lead to stress as these students are not able to co pes with their studies because they were disracted .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision .
There are advantages and disd van tages to using social media sites . However , in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do .
Nowadays , the use of sociall media platforms is a common place in our lives .
In increasingly , global ised world , such platform s even enhances and compli cces at the links between in div ivual sual s in the world .
Thank people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to for business purposes for companies or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing some social changes where , by such virtual world s are over ta kings . The real - world , resulting in some negative impacts in diduas ul ' uls daily lives and , therefore , becoming a large problem in societies as a whole societies .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face - to - face human contact has decres creed .
As people feel more confident online , where they do not have to face in real - life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
This results in lack of inter - al skills in individual , especially young students as they always have option to turn their back to the real - life and go online .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life .
As they are so used to having an online vatr , they may lose their self - ident in real life and may not really be how to interact in real - life - life .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such an enormous time and energy is not relected as something positive to the users .
The reason why it is so addictive . That is that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends .
However , such as sparks of sudden attention is extremely short - term and gone , eily , thus does not add any value or meaning of the user 's life .
Also , according to a research , it has been prove that the users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users not unk wing ly compared their lives with other people 's lives .
But seriously , most people only post happies ppies on their lives .
Social media defined it ly has some other strong benefits that make the users stay in the links among the people .
In addition , I have myself rather use Facebook just because of the friends ' contact s that I want to keep .
However , friendship in such virtual world is so superficial which is not so relevant to the real - life .
Also , as numerous profit - driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond to fish the customers by load  loading many advertisements .
Furthermore , this also possibly trigger s the privcy issues as Facebook allows some other profit - dri companies to have access to information on the users .
As this happens , users are more and more proud to any possible .
Social media sites are at their peak s at the moment . However , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better person s in real - life , they will not be in uled guled on it as much as they are now .
The users , soon , will really is that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends , because if they really need some body , they will reach the friends no matter what is no matter what .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or falling apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people , from around the world .
The idea seems great , and now a day , most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
The parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now follow " their kids more closely and on real time .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to be connected with their so called friends .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face - to - face human contact , that eventually affects our inter - person al skills .
First and for most , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and at different settings .
We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as face book account in order to keep in touch .
Unlike just keep ing contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like face book is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected .
Within click s , we could check on the friend 's profile and read on for his / her updates .
On the other hand , we could update our profile by posting the wall and our friends could read up on the news fe ed .
This allows friends that may not have the time for meeting up to still connected in a way .
Not only that , new friends can be easily met through such online platform s .
Hence , our social circle is in de ed expanding .
No neighbourhood , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that falls apart from using apart .
The obvious disd van TV age of using social media that the time reduction on face - to - face contact .
This remind ly leads to the poor inter inter person al inhibit that the growth of our real social circle .
For example , we tend to send a birthday wishes when Facebook pro ses us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
In fact , we may have just for gotten our friend 's birthday .
We used to send up wishes cards during fes tive season , like Chinese New Year , and we feel so good for write one and , of course , to receive one with stamps on it .
G one were the times , and now we do mass send s and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be red e fined .
Because of the nut shell , every sword has two edges .
The users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world and the virtual one .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms , but be careful of its impacts on the current life that we have .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance e inter person al skills are still through face - to - face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhanc it ease .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in society .
I believe 80 percent of people plays social media sites .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
It consists of the function of connecting , sharing , interacting and advertising .
However , there are also some disdtages to the social media which are concerned about in society .
The refore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily life .
First , with the function of social media sites that connects the people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strange rs without any time and place cons train s train .
Through the social media sites , we can ch at our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
However , we are able to ch at with our friends without travel to the countries .
It saves a lot of money and time as well as strengthen our relationship , although we stay at different places around the world .
Besides that , company can also use the conven't ence of social media sites , such as Facebook choosing or Sky 's meeting with parties from around the world .
Subst an ial cost is saved without the ti ring travel from one point to another point .
With the huge amount of cost saving s , this capital can be utilized in the other sectors which benefits more and boosting the company 's profit .
However , there are two sides of stories .
Some scholars argue that the use of social media reduces the face - to - face connection between human .
Since ancient times , human interacting with others - face by face .
Without the facial impression , it is easier to go on the intention of s .
That is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
In addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills " , that is the point of view in society .
Based on the static report , the more of writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly , for getting how to write a word that we should know .
The auto correct ion software is so effective when using electronic device we did not realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill for person who express their own feelings and opinions .
' P transport ' cy ' , this is the word that are popular in these few decades .
Humans have their own rights and privcy .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
However , there is news about the social media sites leak s users ' information to cash companies with reim burements .
Every cycling , we type of social media sites are recorded in the waiter and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .
Although it looks s like no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
You are not only controlled by the government laws but also spes , I ed by the government .
In conclusion , everything has two sides of stories .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantage s and disd van tages of social media sites .
To utilize technology , we should do our effort to not only balance the pros and cons , but also , encouraging technology , and short environments .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a pros per ous future for our and next generation .
With the wide spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
Ge tting connected on social media , such as face book and twitter has become a main trend as well as daily work nowadays .
With this situation , both advantages and dis ad van tages of using social media apply to our daily life .
On the one side , it is obes a ly that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to get contact with each other every other and everywhere .
Why he are at home or at school , at work or on a holiday , we are able to communicate e and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to have interaction by keep writing comments .
When our phones are accidental ly done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .
Some people who try to talk in public can also active ly take part in the group chting via social media .
Besides , we can make more friends by such interaction s when our friends also bring their friends in .
Therefore , the popular it 's popular of social media sites have made it more convenient for people to do friends ' status and contact with friends more frequently .
On the other hand , we need to recycle about the influences brought by social media .
There are still many disd van tages to using social media .
Firstly , inter person al skills may be a ff acted by the reduction in face - to - face human contact .
While social media brings convenient , I ence to people 's lives , people are more and more willing to use social media for chting instead of face - to - face choosing at which has a time and has a place requirement .
People who are not good at public choosing may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interate person can never be improved under this situation .
Secondly , people 's over - ddion it may avoid ably , to some degree , excer ser bation to social aliens , and this kind of aliens causes some social media users to suffer from over - despite of virtual networking social networking .
More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life .
This is a potential danger for teenager who are growing with social changes to get hurt .
Thirdly , a lot of up ding at the luxury living standard as well as other show - off situations may make people 's daily life more and more grandil quent o quent , which is not an accurate social trend .
Lastly , it is easy for people to was te a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition , and their study and work may be greatly influence .
Since we can see both advantages and disd van tages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may still be lasting for a long time .
The refore , every time we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid be affected by the disdtages tages .
Only by absorb es ses ence and discarding the dg reg s can we make better use of the social media .
In so phtic is at era , like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
Geographic and transportation borders are not a problem any more because communication and information are enhanced solving .
Tele phones may be perceived to be ed as a big innovation created ever when the first time , and it was introduced it .
However , since the internet was known , telephone started to give us a way to social media sites .
Many advantages are given to the users .
Let us take example of Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
Through Facebook , pe opinions are able to maintain relationship with their old a c qua quad in tance s .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particular and may address change from time to while on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using a mail name and photos , for example , as notice the er .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment - add ( i .
social games ) which allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update themselves and express themselves at the same time .
Twitter , that has more s important l ified function compared to Facebook , gives more benefits if used as information sharing the media .
Twitter only allow users to give update that it is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast , that only highlight ed messages are delivered .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be up loaded , long notes can be published , even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays , nowadays .
These advantages s also come s in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smart phones .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side , which people may not realize it before hand .
Research es show that face - to - face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
As the consequence , it affects their people 's interesting skills .
People can think while tying and prepare what they want to say , but in face - to - face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged the picture of your personality .
This skill requires practices and can not be done completely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant , but every body is busy with their own gds , get  posting picture of Facebook , up at ding status on Twitter , or even at Twitter with friends .
These social media serve s a purpose of bins for people in spite of their geographical boundaries , but it does n't mean that the surroundings people are neglected as they pay off .
This is related to the interview person , al skill that it is mentioned before , that can be decreasing qualittive if we are used to facing a gyd , not facing human being .
Another disd van t age that affects other people is that , by only showing part of our lives , we build " false image " in public .
We tend to only share our happy moments in the media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happing ins with no problem at all .
Other people then are influence by us and tend to do the same .
As a result , people think about theirselves , ves low , and may lead to depression and mental disorders .
It also reduces our sympath y .
This is a serious social problem and affects s a lot of people .
As explained above , modern and so phtic is at technology , does n't always give advantages .
There are a lot of disd van tages that people may not realize .
It is up to people 's s disction and comprehensient on to decide which they want to take .
So , we should never for get to think of and calculate the benefit and loss of every decision that we make .
Nowadays , the advancement of technology improves the lives of many people 's lives .
In most countries , there is an emerg ence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people think that the social media sites have benefits of communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .
One of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
However , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter requires some cost , and sending a letter to a person who live far away , especially in villages , especially in villages , takes much time .
The appearance of those social media sites cause those problems to solve .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
The refore , this advantage of social media sites save s money and time , and also provides ven I ence for many people .
More over , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school .
As we graduate from a school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Some of them may have change their phone numbers and address  addresses , and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter .
If phones and letter are the only way to contact them , we will probably not be able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connection between us and our old friends .
Hence , the social media sites serve as a platform for the connection .
Every person comes with benefits s will also have their disdtages .
On the other hand , social media also brings a negative impact on people and society .
The advancement of those social media sites make people so rely on them that some of them prefer rather using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites .
The usage of social media sites in direct ly causes a reduction in face - to - face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of inter - al skills for many people .
As we all know , the inter person al skills are essential for us to communicat ease with each other and to present our views and ideas .
The lost of intertable person 's results in the ability to people well present their ideas .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in society .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies , and also learn to avoid the cons of cons and maximize ize the benefits of those sites .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to keep in - to uch with people and latest news has become a tre menous demand .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
With an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world , social media demonstrated ly success in playing an important part of our lives .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face - to - face human contact , which in turn affects an inter - person al skills .
Let 's examine e the advantages and dis ad van tages of using social media in our daily life and society .
First and for most , all social media sites are free .
All users ' needs are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter I D to start their journey in social media .
Secondly , it helps people to keep in - to uch with one another .
Fin ding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around real life .
Social media help s to less en the has s le distance and bring s people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up - to - ate on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refret sh but to shn .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people through allowing us to create our own groups , pages or sites to share our hobish s , interests and studies in particular subjects .
Hence , it is unden I able to these sites play an important role in our global inter - connect ed world .
However , social media sites also have its second side of negative impact on human .
Unden I able , it becomes more addicting when we spend more time bus ying , social and interacting becoming virtually .
We spend the majority of our time on sites , like Facebook , Twitter and it affects our daily work product and performance .
In corporate world , employing ers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leure is ure ure concentrating on their work .
Using text - me sging a language as an informable way of communicating on social media also brings in a bad impact for us in a long term .
The more time we spend on these sites , the less er time we spend on face - to - face  interacting with one another .
Hence , it less ens valuable interaction between human and time , we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
In addition , there are also some false reports and fake I s occur on both social media sites that people use fake I to in sulted or harasss someone , like the case of the case , he occurred on Facebook .
These ma cious comment on comments often go ral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to unthing the ill attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim .
In conclusion , everything has its two - side - side and it depends on how we exploit it .
With current booming technology , it is agree that people have become more technology - sved and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , but it does not mean that we should neglect - to face human interaction as it even more important aspect in our life .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and Twitter have become ub I quit quitous , sea m less and impertive in our lives , people may wry or ry about the young generation having problems of face - to - face communication skills .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chts at treing rooms treous out we igh their recus per scuses .
Social media enables us to explore the world far away without paying expensive tickets and spat one week holidays .
The conven I ence is beyond description .
With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a ' cke ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .
Compring to face - to - to - face interaction , online conversation is easier for strange rs to open their mouth to each other .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
More over , people usually like to share boldly ly about their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 , 80% of information posted ed online is true while a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real life .
This shows that a face book may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a face book account .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality , while we have no reason to do that in the online world .
Although sometimes those genuine sharing of information may be in app - pri ate or even harmful , such as prevalent val using ulgarbish it gary and harsh me an harsh comments , we can mini - until those recuse through sions of online content .
Another advantage of social media is in aid rather the spread of democracy .
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
That eliminates the incomplete information disd van TV for some remote rural regions where people are less ware of what actually is happening around them .
One of the example , s is the 2012 of 2012 , s happened in Egypt and Zambia .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptian s to people in Zambia  quickly through the use of social media .
However , as the government control s most of the media .
These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public .
For example , in 2012 , the general election is Singapore , Dr Tan Cheken on Keg made use of face book to spread his campaigns to the public .
Though because of this , social media is still a much fair er and more transleagues online platform for public to share ideas compared to other traditional media s .
In ten sive use of Social media does reduce the time people spend in face - to - face communication .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around the table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real - life friends .
In this case , I have to say that to er r is human .
What we can do is to educe at the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disd van tages to our daily life .
What we can do is to caut ious ly manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is unden I able .
Thank you to those social media , the communication among people , all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
A part of the ease of communication despite the distance , many other advantages , such as knowledge sharing and trade can be done through social media as well .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disdtages of tages may appear such as a reduction in face - to - face human contact , which affects the person 's al skills , practising a private issue , as well as some people can be done through social media .
Twitter , Facebook and Sky people are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends , etc . From the surface point of view , it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives spite of the distance .
The sharing of information can be done faster through the social media as well . That is why nowadays , a lot of information s make their own social media account , for example , channels Asia has a witter 's account and will follow its er line with the head news .
That shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , these information can reach them easily without them need to watch or listen to the news reports .
Due to the popular ity of the social media , many people start to do their business via these sites .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online , we can get to buy and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered as an advantage for us , the ers buy ers .
However , it is the same when we keep in touch with someone virtual ly compared to when we meet them personally ?
I do think there is difference in it and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate , we can hide our through feelings and many not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly , to the other one , since the communication is done through written language , and thus the ' ton ' of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online , but in real life , some of them can be very shy and not out sken out sken at all .
This will lead to bad inter - person al skill as well as a problem of trust s .
Nowadays , we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media , since we will never know whether they are even ' al ' al ' .
Some people fake their identities in the media sites , so that they can know more people or some may even che at others .
In addition , doing a private issue that has become more popular nowadays , since some people do not realize some information that they do not will share in the first place .
Therefore , while social media sites are unub ub t ly rather have benefits in our life . We should consider its draw back s and thus use it wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and it disdtages us in the small way as possible .
It is a common scene that almost everyone in public transport is watching at phone or wearing a pair of this modern society today .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order to connect to others even from different countries .
It also brings many negative effects , such as a loss of face - to - face communicating skills which is important in their working place .
This essay will discuss the advantage s and disd van tages of using social media in our daily life .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily , even without contact for a long time .
In this fast pace and competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media site , people are able to up load new discoveries and fun ny scene on it and they can be update on the new information of their friends .
Per son , all I am studying in sea , bus y studying life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Using sing a common social media with my friends to help me know what their status is nowadays .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
In Singapore , many Malaysia n't cross the sea to work here .
Many of them are busy in work and separate their children .
One of Manager in my working place has the same situation .
After my Manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to up load video clips of her grandchi ld .
Therefore , my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Social media sites are also a very useful to ol for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
People get connected or closer to the same preferences .
It is easier for people to approach from other people to know information .
Students can exchange their experience of s in studying , even if they are in different countries .
People are able to share the culture or pretty photos online , so others can spread with them .
Thus , I believe that social media sites are one of useful to help people to know each other better .
However , social media site is a double - side , and it also brings in some negative effect on our daily life .
One of the disd van TV ages that many people concerns is that people lose the interest of face - to - face communication .
Many people like to use language to pretend themselves , and lost confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at public relationship , even without the existence of social media , we can not deny that it affect some people in their ability .
In conclusion , the shadow is always there .
We should take advantages of creatures we create and try to avoid negative effects .
Social media sites have been ose it is a very useful and convenient to use and take people closer to this global is the world .
The use of social media has largely influence d our ways of communicating with one another .
On line , friends have become real life and real life communicate with ease another online .
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interleagues . A person 's pro fod ly .
There are advantages and dis ad van tages in this change .
Social media has shaped the way of communication .
In real life , we communicat with one another as equal participants .
We share ideas , stories and , for ge friendship , based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " .
When we use face book and post pictures and status .
We are actively " presenting " faç a dess of our lives in front of others .
We tend to post picture s with the best look s , status , that are fun ny .
We broadcast these days of us with others .
The images we choose to present ten TV tively considered .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers are not the listeners .
They are just sc - rolling down page s of pages in pictures and status es and see one of them which they might think it fun ny .
It is not the broadcast ers themselves they care about , but the content .
This type of communication does not help for ging interesting person , al relationships .
In real life , establishing friendship requires the all - rounded understanding in one another and the car cycling for one another .
The latter requires face to face interaction , where we can show our emotions to the other .
One can not truly understand a person with only stal king his face page , where he / hes are carefully choose s what to present .
One can not truly show their emotion s by another by texting some reasons ) signs .
The broadcasting and viewing  model is not good for ging relationships s .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is a broadcast er and a view er .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites any more ; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some politics s or public figures .
I have got news for sales , clothes and cos stic me from my friends .
If some of my friends have horried ble taste on clothes and he / he posts them often , I can simply block him / her off .
Information has got circulated .
The most popular information get circulated the most so I can seldom miss it .
Social network plays a role in providing and also filter contaminating information .
This saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching TV .
Per son ally I feel more at e ase on social media .
From the above two points of view , I think social media could for ge more interest - based friendships .
With the help of social media , I become real life friends with those from online for ums whom I share the same interest with .
I also discover some of my friends ' interest which I find common with myself , so that talking to another is much more about life , study , friends , etc .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each other m , but what ever is interesting , or the content .
In this case , inter person al skill is not as important because our goal is not to impess some body , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interview inter person al relationships from a more human - based friendship that requires and caring between friends , to a more information - based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
There are advantages and disd van tages in itself . However , whether it is good or bad , we are still not sure .
It is just different .
Advt an age s and disd van tages of using social media in daily life .
People living in the modern world really can not live without social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Al most students and young adults possess Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media makes people be able to connect another more convenient .
However , it seems that , especially for some those , sharing some parts of their lives , such as video s and photos on the social media sites become really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironing phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat on one table , but none of them were really chting with one another .
In stead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful ful " meeting on their social media sites .
The refore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disd van tages of social media .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicat ease with one another .
People used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with one s live far away from them in the past .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive messages .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just ty ping in front of the computer in their own rooms .
And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message .
D is wotance and time are no longer the problems , which is convenient , especially when instant at is needed .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this conven I ence and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their face - to - to - face person , al skills are lost .
Social media provides people with a way of talking and ch at ting , which can never be considered as a way of communication .
When one s ch at those media sites , there is no eye connection , no emotion and even the expressions are type of ding by using some combinations of practise cts of ctuation s .
For more conven , I ence , sentences are short enps ed to simply three or four words such as los ( l which laugh in ten sive ly ) and " as a " which means as soon as possible ) .
People in deed going to great length of making their words as shortered as they can .
While , once , they are communicating with people in their faces , expressing themselves appropriately , they really become a big problem .
Social media also provides people with huge bving information about people and things that they are interested .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you de or like famous movie and series , business men and entrepreneurs .
It makes people feel extreme close to their a dmirers ' lives and works .
Up dr at news people care about can easily obtain s when you refrefresh your social media sites on your smart phones and lap s almost every time at any time .
However , after one has registered in those social media sites which are not relied , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
The profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to " de core " his or her face .
But there is the possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
Not the most ease of authentic it risks people 's information and privcy that are shared in the media sites .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
It short ens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update update information by using social media .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicat effective ly in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privcy to those who separate identity can not be very ified on the social media sites .
How do social media help change our lives ?
As the development of technology , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world .
Every one in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log stuff of other stuff which helps their friends to know their lives better .
However , it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster .
Although it helps to connect to us with our friends , where vers we are , it at the same time , reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interperson skills al skills .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or dis a disd van tages tages tough question for every human being .
Many people say they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view of how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
This is especially wo n't people who are overseas .
To them , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything happened in their home country and the way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well .
What 's more , these days , social media plays an important role in spreading the information .
Nowadays , people can just put their renting information on their faces account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenient ence .
It is quite significant , especially for those young teenagers , since they will rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also a great number of people who are against this technology .
They wor or a lot about the bad effect on teenagers who are still developing themselves .
They point currently that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
The more we care about face book , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see some party , people will prefer looking at their phones and reading all the post s on face book if they feel bored .
It makes people wry or ry since all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease the ability to talk to people .
They feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people .
Per son ally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disd van tages compared to the advantages it gives us .
A lthough it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life . It was tes us a lot of time as well .
Thk in another way . If we put those time we spend on wer and ering on those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways to contact with our family or friends .
Every wo n't be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media .

Years ago , when these modern products has not been popular , the way for people to communicate or contact people are still restricted in making phone calls , sending mail mails or writing letters .

However , social media solve s these problems well .

Re member to send gret eting s to our friends and family frequently .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate ease where you are .
The appearance of social media sites truly connect s closely people closely .
People can know their friends ' recently look s and interesting things happening on that people just by checking their faces or other social media sites .
We can not deny that social media sites truly make old friends do not lose information and the chances to communicate with you even in a different country .
However , the social media sites truly reduce communication in face - to - face which truly affects s interperson al skills .
There are two advantages and two disdtages to using social media in 's daily life .
Firstly , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely .
By tying the words and showing the pictures , people can express their emotions that they are too shying to express .
For example , on mother 's day , people are shy to say " I love you " to their mother s so they can type of it on his or her mother 's face .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
On the other hand , when teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends .
Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
Secondly , the social media sites can not only connect people with their friends closely .
People can also know a lot of information about Twitter and Facebook , such as local Dear s and get the first hand , studying materials on it .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous people 's thought using the social media .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homes or someone who need money to cure the disease can get to the world quickly , because once one person knows the information , his information or her will share it " area . Then many people will spread and the information who can help .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of social media .
Firstly , when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will use us to communicate by tying and not talking .
People even prefer to talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually - face - to - face communication .
Therefore , the social media truly fully limit the question skills , such as people lose the chance and the ability to practice s and connect the relationship between him and their friends .
Secondly , without the truly communication in real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and false .
There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages . However , in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poor .
Teena gers may believe these people and easily be cheer at and lose money even safe .
Therefore , the social media is not safe , which is bad for teenager 's ' future development .
All in all , the appearance of social media truly helps people in many areas .
However , there are some disadvantages which will affect people in some degree .
